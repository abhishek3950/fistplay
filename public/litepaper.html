        **Rock, Paper, Scissors on Blockchain: A Social Gaming Platform**

**Introduction**

**Rock, Paper, Scissors** is a simple, timeless game that almost everyone knows. Our goal is to bring people together through a series of such easy-to-play games, allowing users to engage in lighthearted competition without a steep learning curve. In today’s world, where many people feel increasingly isolated, we believe that interactive gaming offers a powerful way to connect. The simplicity of **Rock, Paper, Scissors** allows anyone to join in, making it an ideal starting point for this social gaming platform.

**Vision**

The core idea of this platform is to offer **accessible social engagement through fun and simple games**. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** is just the beginning. Over time, we aim to expand this concept into a suite of casual games that foster connection and joy. The beauty of this platform lies in its ability to scale easily into multiple games, providing a variety of experiences that players can enjoy together, while maintaining the core principle: **bringing people together**.

**Why Blockchain?**

The decision to build this platform on blockchain technology stems from the inherent advantages that **blockchains offer** for incentivizing users and maintaining transparency. **Blockchain supercharges engagement** by allowing players to earn rewards for participation, ensuring fairness, and providing transparency. By utilizing a blockchain-based model, we can incentivize players with tokens, ensuring that they are rewarded for their time and engagement.

**Why Build on Base?**

We’ve chosen **Base**, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain, for several key reasons:

1\. **Low Cost**: Base offers lower gas fees compared to many other blockchains, making it an ideal platform for frequent transactions like those in our game.

2\. **EVM Compatibility**: Being an EVM chain, Base benefits from the robust ecosystem that Ethereum developers are familiar with, ensuring easier integration and network effects.

3\. **Scalability**: Base’s infrastructure is built to scale with ease, making it an optimal choice for building a platform that will grow over time.

**Tokenomics**

At this stage, our **token model is designed to be simple**, rewarding players with tokens for winning matches. These tokens represent their engagement and success within the game. As we evolve, the model will become more sophisticated, incorporating elements such as:

• **Early User Incentives**: Early adopters will be incentivized more significantly than later users, ensuring that those who help grow the platform are rewarded proportionately.

• **Dynamic Reward Model**: The rewards players earn will evolve based on several factors, including frequency of play, winning streaks, and other game-specific metrics, creating a dynamic, engaging environment.

**Roadmap**

1\. **Initial Launch**: Focus on perfecting **Rock, Paper, Scissors**, ensuring smooth gameplay, user onboarding, and the integration of token rewards.

2\. **Expansion to Other Games**: Introduce a broader catalog of simple, fun games that can be played for token rewards.

3\. **Incentivization Upgrades**: Develop a more **sophisticated token reward structure**, allowing for features like staking, governance participation, and more.

**Conclusion**

This platform is designed to be a **social gaming experience** that combines the **joy of casual games** with the **power of blockchain**. As we move forward, we aim to grow the ecosystem with more games, improved tokenomics, and enhanced user experiences, creating a sustainable, engaging environment for al
